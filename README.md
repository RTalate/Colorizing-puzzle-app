# Colorisation d'images via le machine learning

## How to run the app
First, build the docker image by running the following command in a terminal :

```bash
docker build . -t puzzle_image
```

Then, run the container:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 puzzle_image
```

The app runs on `http://0.0.0.0:8000/`. If this url does not work, try `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` or `http://localhost:8000/`.

## Scripts behind the app : organization of the repository
To develop the app, we followed several steps.
* **Scrap images** : to obtain enough images to train the model, we scrapped images on Google Image. The scripts for this part are available in the folder `scraping_images`. `scraping.py` does the scraping, and `color_to_bw.py` resizes the images and converts them to black and white. The commands to use to run them are specified at the top of each script. The images are stores in the subfolder `images`, and are in separate zip files in order to stay under the maximum file size in GitHub.
* **Train a colorization model** : we then trained a Convolutional Neural Network on the images in order to set up a model able to colorize greyscale images. The training is done in the folder `colorization_model`. The script `colorization_training.py` trains the CNN and saves the optimal parameters in `model1.pth`.
