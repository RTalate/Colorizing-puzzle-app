Two types of puzzle : sliding puzzle and free movement puzzle

Sliding puzzle : 
- one cell is "empty" and adjacent cells can swap position with that empty cell when clicked
- when all the "picture" pieces are in the right place, all cells display their colored correspondent piece
- a shuffle button on the right side of the puzzle ( ! some initial combinations are unsolvable ! )

Free movement puzzle :

- to place a piece, click first on the piece below and then on a cell
- click on a non-empty cell to remove a piece
- shuffle button will shuffle the available pieces
- when all the "picture" pieces are in the right place, all cells display their colored correspondent piece
